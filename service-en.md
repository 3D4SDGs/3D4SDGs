# Introduction of the 3D model provision service

## Service overview
We are conducting research with the aim of realizing a society in which visually impaired people can freely access what they want, anytime, anywhere, by 2030. As part of this, we are conducting trial operation of a 3D model provision service. This is a service for receiving requests for models that the visually impaired want to touch, outputting them with a 3D printer, and delivering the 3D models. If you have a model you want to touch, please submit a request using the following procedure.

## How to apply
Please send your request by e-mail or web form.

E-mail: 3d4sdgs+request@gmail.com

In your request, please include your name, the name of the object you want to touch, your contact information (e-mail, etc.) for confirmation and inquiries, and the shipping address. It takes about one or several months to send a model. It also depends on the postal situation in each country.

If the 3D model data to be output by the 3D printer has been decided, please attach the data to an e-mail or let us know the URL where the data can be downloaded. It is possible to find 3D model data on websites such as Thingiverse that upload data created by volunteers.

We hope to ask a person who is sent a 3D model to complete a questionnaire for improving the service and for future R&D. Thank you for your cooperation.

## Limitations

At present, we do not have a system to produce our own 3D model data. Therefore, items for which 3D model data is not available cannot be printed. Even if there is 3D model data, printing may not be possible with the 3D printer we use.

Some 3D models have sharp elements. Please touch them slowly and with care. We cannot be held responsible for injuries while touching a 3D model.

When a 3D model is sent, even if it breaks while you are touching it, we do not handle repairs.

Our service has had experience in printing the following 3D model data.
1. The Parthenon
2. The Pantheon (a facility dedicated to the national greats of France, where Louis Braille is interred)
3. Notre Dame cathedral
4. The Taj Mahal
5. Angkor Wat
6. Sydney Opera House
7. Castel del Monte (a medieval castle in southern Italy)
8. Castillo (a pyramid in Mexico; aka “Kukulcan Temple”)
9. Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore

This service is implemented as part of the Japan Science and Technology Agency's "Co-creative R&D Program for Achieving SDGs.".
